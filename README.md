#### *Build the best - destroy the rest!*

**robocodeGL** is a recreation of the programming game [robocode](https://github.com/robo-code/robocode), where the goal is to develop a robot battle tank to battle against other tanks in Java. 
The robot battles are either running in real-time and on-screen, or in full speed and off-screen.
